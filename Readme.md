# Asteroid Diameter Prediction Using Orbital Elements

This project focuses on predicting asteroid diameters using orbital parameters and mechanics. It combines astronomical theory with data science to analyze asteroid orbital features and build models that estimate their sizes.

## Overview

The notebook explores and explains the following orbital elements:
- Semi-Major Axis
- Eccentricity
- Orbital Period
- Inclination
- Longitude of Ascending Node
- Argument of Perihelion

These features are used to develop a machine learning model that predicts asteroid diameters based on their orbital characteristics.

## Features

- Explanation of key orbital mechanics concepts
- Data preparation for asteroid-related parameters
- Model training to predict asteroid diameters
- Interpretations of input-output relationships for educational value

## How to Run

This notebook is designed to run in **Google Colab**:

1. Upload and open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`)
3. Run the cells sequentially to load data, process features, train the model, and generate predictions

## Output

- Interpretation of orbital parameters and their relevance to asteroid properties
- Machine learning model to predict asteroid diameters
- Visual analysis of prediction performance and feature relationships
